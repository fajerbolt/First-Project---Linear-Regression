# First-Project---Linear-Regression
I am a begginer in the field of Data Science and used this project as a means to expand my skills and knowledge.
The problem that I solved is given here: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/

I would welcome any suggestions on how to improve this project or how to further develop as a data scientist.
